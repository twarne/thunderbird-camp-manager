export const RAPPELLING_RELEASE = `
I understand that participation in the climbing/rappelling activity offered through the Thunderbird Park Stake, involves a certain degree of risk that result in injury or death.

In consideration of the benefits to be derived and after carefully considering the risk involved, and in view of the fact that the
Boy Scouts of America is an organization in which membership is voluntary, and having full confidence that precautions will
be taken to ensure the safety and will-being of my son/daughter, I have given my son/daughter my consent to participate
in the rappelling activity at Young Women's Camp between June 17-20, 2019.

You are about to take part in a climbing experience. While climbing/rappelling, you will undertake a wide variety of
physical and mental challenges in an environment designed with safety in mind.
Many participants ask about the physical requirements for taking part in the activity. We find that the best way to
answer this question is to compare course activities to a variety of common pastimes with which many of us are familiar.
For most of the time, you will be undertaking activity that is best described as “moderate exertion.” This is
comparable to normal walking, golfing on foot, downhill skiing, raking leaves, waiting tables, fishing, calisthenics, hanging
wallpaper, interior painting, or slow dancing. There will be some situations where, for a few minutes, you will be engaged in
“vigorous exertion.” This is comparable to slow jogging, speed-walking, tennis, swimming, cross-country skiing, shoveling
snow, fast biking, mowing with a push mower, pruning trees, heavy gardening, overhead work, ice hokey drill, softball,
laying bricks, hurried restaurant work or climbing a ladder.
If these types of activities are difficult for you, we would like to have you discuss your participation in the activity
with a physician who knows your health history. If these are activities in which you regularly engage without difficulty, you
should be fit for participation.
Lastly, there are a few specific medical conditions about which participants should always seek advice from their
physicians before engaging in climbing/rappelling. If any of these apply to you, you must consult with a physician before
participating. If you or your physicians have any questions about these conditions or about climbing/rappelling activities,
feel free to contact your ward camp director.
• Pregnancy (the climbing harness can injure the uterus.)
• Kidney or liver transplant (The climbing harness can injure the transplanted organ.)
• Healing fracture or joint injury (You should be cleared by the treating physician.)
• Recent surgery (You should be cleared by the treating physician.)
• Down Syndrome (The participant should have an x-ray check for neck stability as per the recommendations of the
Special Olympics.)
I certify that this participant can meet the health and physical fitness requirement of the trip or activity.
In the event of illness or injury occurring to my son/daughter while involved in this trip or activity, I consent to Xray examination, anesthesia, and/or medical or surgical diagnostic procedures or treatment considered necessary in the best
judgment of the attending physician and performed by or under the supervision of a member of the medical staff of the
hospital furnishing medical services, It is understood that in the event of a serious illness or injury, reasonable efforts to
reach me will be made.
