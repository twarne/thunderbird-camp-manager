            his or her own conduct and is aware of and agrees to abide by Church standards, camp, or event safety rules

            and exemplify Christlike behavior. Parents and participants should understand that participation in an
            activity is not a right but a privilege that can be revoked if they behave inappropriately or if they pose a
